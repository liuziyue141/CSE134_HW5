## Recent Changes (March 2025)

I've made several significant improvements to my portfolio website to enhance its functionality, user experience, and maintainability:

1. **Custom Elements Implementation**: 
   - Created a reusable `<project-card>` custom element using the CustomElements API
   - Implemented proper encapsulation with Shadow DOM
   - Used CSS variables for consistent styling that adapts to light/dark themes
   - Built responsive layouts with CSS Grid to ensure cards look good on all devices

2. **Dynamic Data Loading**:
   - Added functionality to load project data from both localStorage and a remote JSON server
   - Implemented "Load Local" and "Load Remote" buttons for users to refresh content
   - Set up error handling for robust user experience
   - Created a clean and organized data structure for project information

3. **CSS Improvements**:
   - Enhanced responsive design with better mobile support
   - Added smooth hover animations and transitions
   - Improved accessibility with better contrast and focus states
   - Organized CSS with logical grouping and comments

4. **JavaScript Enhancements**:
   - Refactored code to use modern ES6+ syntax
   - Improved error handling throughout the application
   - Enhanced performance by minimizing DOM manipulation
   - Added clear, descriptive commit messages to track changes

5. **Content Organization**:
   - Restructured project section for better information hierarchy
   - Improved visual consistency across sections
   - Made project information more scannable and accessible

These changes significantly improve both the user experience and the maintainability of the code, while demonstrating my skills in modern web development techniques.
